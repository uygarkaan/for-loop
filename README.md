## For Loop Example

This project provides a simple example of using a `for` loop in Java. The code demonstrates how to use a `for` loop to iterate through a range of numbers and print each number to the console.

### Features
- Uses a `for` loop to iterate from 0 to 10, inclusive.
- Prints each number in the range to the console.

### Code Breakdown
- `for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i++)` initializes the loop variable `i` to 0 and continues the loop as long as `i` is less than or equal to 10. 
- `System.out.println(i);` prints the current value of `i` during each iteration of the loop.

### Usage
This example is useful for understanding the basic structure and functionality of a `for` loop in Java. Modify the loop parameters to explore different ranges and behaviors.
